#How to handle time between registered users and non-registered users:

#Time stored for items
MongoDB = UTC
localStorage = MM/DD... need to fix


Registered Users (MongoDB pure)
Client gets UTC (MongoDB)
    parseLocale() => localeTime 'MM/dd'

**to fix**
    - parseLocale to full date with time, not just 'MM/dd'

NonRegistered Users (localStorage + MongoDB)
Submit locale 'MM/dd' + objId
    Confirm(objId === MongoDBId) => Chart(locale MM/dd)

**to fix**
    - a lot of shit
